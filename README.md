# Driver Drowsiness Detection
Driver Drowsiness Detection is developed by the students of Charotar University Of Science And Technology.

Driver drowsiness is one of the most dangerous problem. Drowsy driving is one of the main cause of vehicle road accident on highways. Drowsy driving is state of unconsciousness when driver is not fully active on road. This can lead to serious injuries or death.

To solve this problem we have implemented detection system using keras based Pre-trained model Inception-v3 to predict the state of condition of driver.

We have Used MRL eye dataset and Yawn eye dataset new (kaggle) to training and testing this model. we have used Haar Cascade Face Algorithm for detect the face from webcam.
